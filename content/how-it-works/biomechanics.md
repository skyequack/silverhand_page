# Biomechanics

The human hand achieves grasp through coordinated flexion of 27 bones and 34 muscles. SilverHand replicates this using a four-bar linkage mechanism: a single rotary input (MG996R servo) drives proportional finger flexion across all four fingers simultaneously.

The servo mounts on the dorsal side of the hand, with 3D-printed linkages transferring torque to finger-mounted cuffs. This mechanical advantage amplifies the servo's ~10 kg·cm stall torque to 2-4 kg fingertip force—sufficient for grasping bottles, utensils, and lightweight objects.

Total mass: ~150g (servo: 55g, linkages: 60g, electronics: 35g). Weight distribution centers over the wrist to minimize fatigue during extended wear. The mechanism locks in the extended position, requiring no power to maintain an open hand.
