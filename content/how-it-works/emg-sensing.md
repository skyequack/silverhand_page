# EMG Sensing

Electromyography (EMG) detects electrical potentials generated by muscle fiber depolarization. SilverHand uses two surface electrodes on the forearm flexor muscles (e.g., flexor carpi radialis) to capture signals in the 20-450 Hz band.

The analog front-end amplifies these microvolt-level signals (100-5000 µV) using an INA128 instrumentation amplifier (gain = 100-1000). A TL074-based active bandpass filter (20-450 Hz) removes motion artifacts and 60 Hz mains interference. The signal is then rectified and smoothed before being read by an Arduino Nano's 10-bit ADC.

This processed signal represents muscle activation intensity—higher muscle contraction produces higher voltage. A calibrated threshold determines when the user intends to grasp, triggering servo actuation.
