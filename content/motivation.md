# Personal Motivation

Growing up, I watched my grandmother struggle with rheumatoid arthritis as her fingers gradually curled inward, unable to grasp a coffee mug or button her coat. Simple tasks became insurmountable barriers. I was 12 when I first thought: *Why can't we build something to help?*

Years later, after studying mechanical engineering and robotics, I realized the technology exists—but the devices are locked behind prohibitive costs, clinical gatekeeping, or academic obscurity. Most assistive robotics research ends in journals, never reaching the people who need it.

I believe **disabilities should be mild inconveniences, like wearing glasses**. Just as corrective lenses restore vision, powered exoskeletons can restore grasp. The difference is cost and accessibility. A pair of glasses costs $100; a powered hand orthosis costs $20,000.

SilverHand is my attempt to change that equation. By open-sourcing every design file, schematic, and line of code, I hope to democratize access to this technology. If even one person builds this and regains the ability to hold their grandchild's hand, this project will have succeeded.

This is personal. This is necessary. This is SilverHand.
